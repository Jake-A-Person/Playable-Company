# Introduction
<p> A Victoria 3 mod that allows the player to play as a company. While you can play as the east India company or the Hudson’s bay company. However, you are pretty much just playing as a normal country with a few buffs. This mod then intends to allow you to play as a conational company with no territory however you can build and own buildings.</p>
